<center><h2>The role of robotics</h2></center>
<p>The use of pattern recognition techniques are often helpful for localization the prevailing of the cells of the virus within the body for instance Russia uses face recognition to tackle Covid-19.</p>
<p>A new article in New York  posited that governments’ use of digital surveillance techniques for the COVID-19 response  just like the tracking of geolocation to live quarantine restrictions – would cause more pervasive digital tracking within the longer term. On another side, there are reports of an increased use of face recognition technologies as governments use digital tools to reply to the outbreak so City officials are using a giant network of tens of thousands of cameras installed with facial recognition software.</p>
<p>Computer science can develop apps that help with contact tracing, testing and warning beforehand a few hotspot of the disease. of these are often achieved using AI algorithms.
</p>
<p>In one article, it was written that the role of robots in the face of virus is very great. Robots have the ability to spread them for cleansing, delivering medications and food, measuring vital signs.</p>
<p>Robots could even be trained to swab patients’ noses and throats so as to check for infection, Such a process might be more efficient and also reduce the danger to healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>robots could benefit from ultraviolet light devices in disinfection the surfaces in hospitals, reducing the need for disinfection by hospital workers, and thereby also reducing the risk to those workers.<p/>
<p>Tools like thermal sensors and facial recognition software could help ease the burden of Group examination in high-traffic places like airports by allowing robots to take part in it.
